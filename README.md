# Networked-Chat-Program

This networked chat program allows users to communicate over a network using the console.
The project uses multi-threading to have uninterrupted processing of network packets.

Users can start a server and broadcast it so other users can connect.
All messages recieved by the server are sent out to all connected clients,
allowing everyone to talk over the network.
